# p5.modulate Project Plan

## Overview
p5.modulate is a p5.js library that provides modular synthesizer-inspired utilities for creative coding. The library includes LFO, Envelope, and Sequencer components that can be used to create dynamic animations and behaviors.

  - [ ] Review factory methods
  - [ ] Standardize method naming
  - [ ] Consider adding convenience methods
  - [ ] Document public API
- [ ] Enhance functionality
  - [ ] Add input validation and error handling
  - [ ] Review and optimize performance
  - [ ] Consider adding more easing functions
  - [ ] Add utility methods for common operations
- [ ] Testing and validation
  - [ ] Manual testing of all timing types
